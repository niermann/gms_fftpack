Documentation
======================================================================

The documentation uses the Sphinx (sphinx.pocoo.org) documentation system,
which in turn requires a working Python (www.python.org) installation. 
To build the documentation simply go into the documentation subdirectory
(doc/) and invoke the sphinx system (e.g. by calling make.bat html)
