Introduction
======================================================================

The plugin contains FFT functions for Digital Micrograph:

    * with non-power of two array shape
    * with single and double precision
    
The functions are based on the fftpack.c implementation provided with 
the numpy package (see www.numpy.org). 

Install

Simply copy the fftpack.dll to the plugin directory of your Digital
Micrograph installation. By default these are for GMS-2.X:
    c:\ProgramData\Gatan\Plugins
and for GMS-1.X:
    c:\Program Files\Gatan\DigitalMicrograph\Plugins
